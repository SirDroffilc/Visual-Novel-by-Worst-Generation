# Closed;Open (Visual Novel Game) by Worst Generation
A psychological horror and drama visual novel game mainly developed using Ren'Py and Roblox Studio.

## Closed;Open
Ethan wakes up in a strange and unfamiliar facility with no memory of how he got there. The building spans three eerie floors, each one hiding obstacles, puzzles, and locked rooms that bar his escape. To move forward, he must search, explore, and earn the keys that will let him advance.

But the real challenge lies beyond the locked Main Rooms. Each of these rooms is a portal into a period of time in Ethan's life, full of confrontations with painful memories, anxieties, and regrets that he must face head-on. 

‚ÄúClosed;Open‚Äù blends psychological horror with drama, mixing interactive exploration, puzzle-solving, and story-driven revelations. It is a journey of self-realization, forgiveness, and growth‚Äîone that forces both Ethan, and the player, to confront what lies behind the doors we keep shut.
